## General info
This project is a personal project of mine. The rational behind creating this was due to my upcoming Japan trip where my friends and I found it very annoying and tedious to figure out the most efficient route to visit each of the locations we wanted to explore. 

This application aims to solve that problem by taking a list of locations as input and outputs the most efficient route to visit all the given locations.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java 17
* Spring Web MVC
* Google Maps API
* Java Server Pages (JSP)
* HTML5
* CSS
	
 ## Features
- Takes a user input of locations and generates the most efficient route to visit all the given locations.
- The starting location can be chosen by the user or chosen to optimise efficiency.
- Calculates route based off either duration or distance.
- Duration/distance values account for different transport methods (Driving, Transit, Walking) as specified by the user.
