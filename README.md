## General Info

The rational behind creating this was due to my upcoming trip where my friends and I found it very annoying and tedious to figure out the most efficient route to visit each of the locations we wanted to explore.

This application aims to solve that problem by taking a list of locations as input and outputs the most efficient route plans to visit all the given locations.

## Technologies

- Java 17
- Google Maps API
- Java Server Pages (JSP)
- HTML5
- CSS

## Features

- Takes a user input of locations and generates the most efficient route to visit all the given locations.
- The starting location can be chosen by the user or chosen to optimize efficiency.
- Calculates route based on either duration or distance.
- Duration/distance values account for different transport methods (Driving, Transit, Walking) as specified by the user.
- We used powerful algorithms (e.g., brute force approach) to efficiently optimize road routing in these areas.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., VS Code)
3. Ensure you have Java 17 installed
4. Set up Google Maps API integration
5. Build and deploy the project using Maven
